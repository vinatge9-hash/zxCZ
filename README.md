# Niyantri Coffee - Site Build (Mock/API Driven, PayPal Sandbox)

This project is a fully responsive, full-width (fluid) coffee shop website built with Tailwind CSS. It uses mock APIs on the client side for data and a PayPal Sandbox integration for checkout.

Whatâ€™s included
- Pages: Home (index.html), Menu (menu.html), Cart (cart.html), Checkout (checkout.html), About (about.html), Contact (contact.html)
- Fluid, full-width layout with responsive design via Tailwind CSS
- Mock APIs for menu data and order submission
- Cart stored in localStorage with add/remove/update capabilities
- PayPal Sandbox integration on Checkout
- Placeholder images described by placeholder syntax as required
- README with setup notes

How to run
1) Open index.html in a browser. The site is static and uses client-side JS for the mock APIs.
2) Navigate to Menu to add items to the cart, go to Cart to review, then Checkout to complete a mock PayPal flow.
3) All data is stored locally in your browser (localStorage).

Notes
- The design uses the coffee color palette: primary #6f4e37, cream #f8f2e9, accent #d19f51.
- Font pairing: Merriweather for headings and Inter for body.
- Images use the required placeholder format: src="https://pixabay.com/get/g5f6c3d33b744778a0c9d01c50796dcd625789d381c9d01bf21d70795dd8ec4a9d8544bbc70e922b747d7708de9e36e2468609f89131d75e254d924805549a6bb_640.jpg" in data items.
